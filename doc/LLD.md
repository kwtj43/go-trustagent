*Note:  This document does not include details regarding the installation and operation of application-integity or workload-agent.*

# Installation
Installation is reponsible for deploying dependencies, GTA files, creating system users/services, etc.  GTA is distributed as a self extracting makeself/.bin file that supports the following use cases...

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
|Minimal Install| The GTA makeself installer will perform a 'minimal install' when there is *not* a `trustagent.env` in the current directory (or when that file contains `PROVISION_ATTESTATION=n`). It only installs dependencies, the GTA files and creates users/services, etc.  After a minimal install, GTA must be provisioned via `tagent setup` and started to be integrated into the ISecL platform.|
|Automatic Provisioning| The GTA makeself installer will perform 'automatic provisioning' when a valid `trustagent.env` file in the current directory (and the file contains `PROVISION_ATTESTATION=y`).  'Automatic provisioning' will perform a 'Minimal Install' and also configures GTA for integration with ISecL.|
| Uninstall|  Allows the administrator to remove the GTA from the host.|

*For installation instructions see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).*

## Minimal Install
During minimal installation, the installer performs the following activities...
1. Installs 3rd party software dependencies ([see Software Dependencies](#software-dependencies))
2. Creates the 'tagent' user, adding it to the 'tss' group so that it can access TPM (ex. /dev/tpm0)
3. Deploys the files for GTA.
5. Creates tagent systemd services.

*After a minimal install is completed, the administrator must provision the GTA and start the 'tagent' service.  See [Setup](#setup).*

## Automatic Provisioning
When the GTA installer is invoked with a valid `trustagent.env` file in the same directory (see [trustagent.env Reference](#trustagent.env-reference)), and that file contains `PROVISION_ATTESTATION=Y`, the installer will...
1. Perform the 'minimal installation' steps listed above.
2. Starts the `tpm2-abrmd` service to provision the TPM, AAS/CMS and HVS.
3. Invokes `tagent setup` (see [Setup](#setup) for more information).
4. Start the `tagent` service.

## Automatic Registration
When the GTA installer is invoked with a valid `trustagent.env` file in the same directory (see [trustagent.env Reference](#trustagent.env-reference)), and that file contains `AUTOMATIC_REGISTRATION=Y` as well as `PROVISION_ATTESTATION=Y`, the installer will...
1. Perform the 'minimal installation' steps listed above.
2. Perform the 'automatic provisioning' steps listed above.
3. Register the host with HVS by calling `tagent setup create-host` and `tagent setup create-host-unique-flavor`.

## Uninstall
After installation is completed, `tagent uninstall` can be run to remove the GTA.  Uninstall will...
1. Stop and disable the `tagent` service.
2. Uninstall `tboot-xm`.
3. Remove all files GTA files in `/opt/trustagent`.

# Setup
GTA exposes a command line interface (CLI) that supports 'setup'. Setup is the process of provisioning the GTA for use/integration in the ISecL platform.  Provisioning falls into three categories...

|Category|Description|
|--------|-----------|
|TPM Provisioning|Performs operations on the host's TPM to establish ownership and allocate keys/certs to support remote attestation. |
|AAS/CMS Provisioning|Provisions the TLS certificate, users and roles needed for ISecL microservices to access the GTA http endpoints.|
|HVS Provisioning|Interacts with HVS to establish authentication during remote-attestation.|

By default, the `tagent setup` command (or `tagent setup all`) is used during installation to provision the TPM, AAS/CMS and HVS and performs the tasks listed in the table below.  When completed successfully, GTA will be started as a service.  `tagent` will exit with an error code if any of the tasks fail. 

`tagent setup` executes the setup commands in the order listed below. 

|Task|Description|Results| Env Var(s)|
|----|-----------|-------|-----------|
|download-root-ca-cert|Downloads the root CA certificate from Certificate Management Service (CMS)|Creates a .pem file containing the Root CA certificate chain (root CA and Intermediate CA) in /opt/trustagent/configuration/cacerts/|CMS_BASE_URL, CMS_TLS_CERT_SHA384|
|download-ca-cert|Generates a asymmetric keypair and obtains the signed TLS certificate for Trust Agent webservice from Certificate CMS|Creates two files in /opt/trustagent/configuration: tls-key.pem containing the private key and tls-cert.pem containing the signed public key TLS cert signed by CMS|CMS_BASE_URL, TA_TLS_CERT_CN (optional), SAN_LIST, BEARER_TOKEN|
|download-privacy-ca|Downloads a certificate from HVS (/ca-certificates/privacy) which is used to encrypt data during 'provision-aik'. |Creates /opt/trustagent/configuration/privacy-ca.cer.|HVS_URL, BEARER_TOKEN|
|take-ownership|Uses the value of TPM_OWNER_SECRET (or generates a new random secret) to take ownership of the TPM. |Takes ownership of the TPM and saves the secret key in /opt/trustagent/configuration/config.yml.  Fails if the TPM is already owned.|TPM_OWNER_SECRET|
|provision-ek|Validates the TPM's endorsement key (EK) against the list stored in HVS.|Validates the TPM's EK against the  manufacture certs downloaded from HVS (/ca-certificates?domain=ek).  Stores the manufacture EKs from HVS at /opt/trustagent/configuration/endorsement.pem.  Returns an error if the TPM EK is not valid.  Optionally registers the EK with HVS (if not present).|TPM_OWNER_SECRET, HVS_URL, BEARER_TOKEN|
|provision-aik|Performs dark magic that provisions an AIK with HVS, supporting the ability to collect authenticated tpm quotes. |Generates an AIK secret key that is stored in /opt/trustagent/configuration/config.yml.  Creates /opt/trustagent/configuration/aik.cer that is hosted in the /aik endpoint.|TPM_OWNER_SECRET, HVS_URL, BEARER_TOKEN|
|provision-primary-key|Allocates a primary key in the TPM used by WLA to create the binding/singing keys.|Allocates a new primary key in the TPM at index 0x81000000.|TPM_OWNER_SECRET|

*Note:  While GTA supports the option of independently executing the tasks below (ex. `tagent setup provision-ek`), it is not recommended due to complex ordering and interdependencies.*

# Operations
Provided the trust-agent has been installed and provisioned (aka 'setup'), administrators are then able to manage the service and register the host with HVS (to integrate the host into the ISecL platform). 

## Service Management
During installation, /opt/trustagent/tagent.service is created and enabled with systemd.  The following table shows the service commands for managing GTA...

|Action|Command|'systemctl' Command|
|------|-------|-----------------|
|Start tagent service|tagent start|`systemctl start tagent`|
|Stop tagent service|tagent stop|`systemctl stop tagent`|
|Get the status tagent service|tagent status|`systemctl status tagent`|
|Restart the tagent service|tagent restart|`systemctl restart tagent`|

Once the trust-agent is successfully operating under systemd, it will be restarted after system boot.

## HVS Registration/Configuration
Provided GTA service is running, the agent can be registered with HVS to support remote-attestation, asset-tagging, etc.  Registration entails adding the host to HVS' list of known hosts and establishing flavors for the host.  There are two ways to register the host with HVS...
1. 'CLI Initiated Registration' using GTA's command line interface (i.e. 'create-host')
2. 'HVS Initiated Registration' using HVS REST APIs.

### CLI Initiated Registration
1. Assume the GTA service is started and operational.
2. Execute `tagent setup create-host` to add the local host to HVS' list of known hosts.
3. Execute `tagent setup create-host-unique-flavor` to add the host's unique flavors to a flavor group in HVS.

### HVS Initiated Registration
1. Assume the GTA service is started and operational.
2. Use HVS' `/hvs/v2/hosts` (POST) to add the host to HVS' list of known hosts.
3. Use HVS' `/hvs/v2/flavors` (POST) to add the host's flavors to a flavor group in HVS.

Once registered/configured with HVS, the host will be available for quotes, asset tagging and other ISecL use cases.

# TrustAgent APIs

## AAS User/Roles

Authentication on the basis of stored credentials (BasicAuth) has been deprecated and going forward all Trust Agent APIs will use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) supplied the Authentication field of the request header to authenticate the source of the request.

The JWT tokens must be:

1. Currently valid - current server time on TA must be between *issued at (iat)* time and *expires at (eat)* time of JWT
2. Contain the permissions required by the API in Permissions field.
3. Signed by an known instance of Authentication and Authorization Service (AAS) configured at the the time of the deployment (using the **download-aas-jwt-cert** setup task).

The public certificate of the AAS instance will be provisioned to the TA service at the time of installation to ascertain JWT source's credibility and also validity (expiry time) and

## Software Dependencies
The GTA installer will update the system with the following dependencies.

    1. tpm2-abrmd-2.1
    2. tpm2-tss-2.0
    2. dmidecode-3
    3. redhat-lsb-core-4.1
    4. tboot-1.9.7*
    5. compat-openssl10-1.0

\* tboot is only installed when sUEFI is not enabled.  

## config.yml
The GTA stores configuration information in /opt/trustagent/configuration/config.yml.  The contents of the file is based on environment variables (`trustagent.env`) provided during `tagent setup`.  The example below includes comments that correlate the configuration item to environment variables defined in `trustagent.env`.
